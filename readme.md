Casset
======

Casset is a new asset management library for Ruby, and will support Sinatra initially.

It's a port (with more) of [fuelphp-casset](https://github.com/canton7/fuelphp-casset).  
Its main feature is advanced asset grouping, and it also suppots parsing (SASS, etc), and minifying.

This project is still pre-release work-in-progress, and isn't yet advanced enough for use on a website.
It will be up to v1.0 soon, though!
